# bash openvz-monitor
This bash script can print to putty window information about openvz containers
This is only example how can it be done
May be later ill add graphics and all other resources (like networks statistics (mails per second, tcp packages per second, udp packages per second, udp packages per second and so on))

To run it simply type bash mon.sh in OpenVZ Node or chmod a+x mon.sh and then ./mon.sh

It can be used to create rrd graphs and so on.
